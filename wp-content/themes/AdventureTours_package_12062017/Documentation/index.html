<h2>Shortcodes</h2><blockquote>

<pre><code>[shortcode_name attribute1=&quot;value1&quot; attribute2=&quot;value2&quot;]
</code></pre><p>There are over 20 custom shortcodes in Adventure Tours. You can also use <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/">WordPress built-in shortcodes</a> as well as shortcodes provided by installed plugins, like WooCommerce or Revo Slider.</p>
<p>Shortcodes can be inserted into a post or page body. On the top bar above the text editor area, there is a Shortcodes icon. Click on it and select a shortcode.</p>
<p><img src="img/shortcodes-icon.png" class="img-polaroid"></p>

<h2>Customize Theme</h2><p>In order to customize theme colors and typography, go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Customizer</strong>. In the left sidebar there are options for editing. The changes can be previewed as soon as they are made.</p>
<p>You can also add your own CSS styles at <strong>Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; General &gt; Custom CSS</strong>.</p>
<h3>Child Theme</h3><blockquote>
<p>Note: to understand the current section, you should have basic knowledge of CSS and HTML. It is also desirable to have basic understanding of WordPress theme development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are too many style changes or if you also plan to change some HTML, we recommend to create a child theme and make customizations there. It is a requirement to use the child theme if you want to keep the theme updated as well as preserve your customizations. If you are modifying Adventure Tours files, you should not make theme updates.</p>
<p>To create a child theme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy <code>adventure-tours-child</code> folder from your purchased archive to <code>wp-content/themes</code> folder.</li>
<li>Activate child theme at <strong>Admin Panel &gt; Appearance &gt; Themes</strong>. Now you can add your CSS rules to <code>adventure-tours-child/style.css</code> file as well as redefine theme templates in the child theme folder. (Copy a template file from Adventure Tours to the child theme and customize it.) You can familiarize yourself with child themes <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Custom Shortcode Templates</h3><p>All shortcode templates are located in the folder <code>adventure-tours/templates/shortcodes</code>. The name of the file is equal to the shortcode name. For example, the <code>[title]</code> shortcode template is located at <code>adventure-tours/templates/shortcodes/title.php</code>. You can modify shortcode templates as well as create new ones and use them to your needs.</p>
<p>For example, to modify <code>[contact_info]</code> shortcode, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the file <code>adventure-tours/templates/shortcodes/title.php</code> to <code>adventure-tours-child/templates/shortcodes/title.php</code></li>
<li>Modify the shortcode as you prefer and save it.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><a name="translate-theme"></a></p>
<h2>Translate Theme</h2><p>You can either install <strong>WPML</strong> plugin to translate your theme in other languages, or you can follow steps described below.</p>
<p>For example, you want your site to be in French. So your locale name will be <code>fr</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the file located at <code>/wp-content/themes/adventure-tours/languages/adventure-tours.pot</code> to <code>/wp-content/languages/themes/adventure-tours-fr_FR.po</code>.</li>
<li>Download and install the program called <a href="http://poedit.net/download">POEdit</a>.</li>
<li>Open the copied file <code>/wp-content/languages/themes/adventure-tours-fr_FR.po</code> with POEdit program.</li>
<li>Start translating. When you are finished, save the file and check that the file <code>/wp-content/languages/themes/adventure-tours-fr_FR.mo</code> has been generated.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong> and scroll to the bottom, select <em>Français</em> from the <strong>Site Languages</strong> dropdown, press <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you should have your theme translated into your language!</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><br>If you don't see your changes on the site, please check following:</p>
<ul>
<li>check that you uploaded your files to <code>/wp-content/languages/themes/</code> folder and not to <code>/wp-content/themes/adventure-tours/languages/</code> folder;</li>
<li>check that you file has correct name like <code>adventure-tours-{fr_FR}.po</code> and <code>adventure-tours-{fr_FR}.mo</code>. {fr_FR} (&quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; symbols just to show part that should be corrected for your case ). This suffix depends on the language that selected in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong> section in <strong>Site Languages</strong> option. So check what language selected there as well.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Theme Updates</h2><p>To be notified of new theme updates, you should turn on <strong>Update Notifier</strong> button at <strong>Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; General</strong> (is enabled by default).</p>
<p><img src="img/update-notifier.png" class="img-polaroid"></p>
<p>There are two locations on the website where you can see that there is a new version of Adventure Tours available:</p>
<ul>
<li>on top Admin toolbar</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/new-version-available.png" class="img-polaroid"></p>
<ul>
<li>at <strong>Admin panel &gt; Appearances &gt; Adventure Tours</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/theme-update.png" class="img-polaroid"></p>
<p>This section contains information about updates that are available in the new version. You can see the changelog of versions at <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/adventure-tours-wordpress-tourtravel-theme/12781942#item-description__updates-history">item details page</a>, as well.</p>
<p>If you did not make any changes in Adventure Tours theme files and in Data types for Adventure Tours theme plugin files, you should follow the instructions below. Otherwise, you will loose all your changes during this update process.</p>
<p>Since Wordpress does not provide any API to update theme automatically (automatic updates are available for themes published on wordpress.org only), the theme update process requires a few additional steps from your side.</p>
<p>We recommend to use Envato WordPress Toolkit plugin to update Adventure Tours theme. This plugin allows updating your theme in a truly handy way. Please check this guide <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/envato-wordpress-toolkit-guide/">here</a> on how to install and use this plugin to update your themes purchased from Envato.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: theme updates via Envato WordPress Toolkit plugin up to version 2.2.6 may fail. To avoid this issue, please check <a href="#error-with-envato-toolkit-plugin">this topic</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, please take in consideration that Adventure Tours theme is provided with the following built-in plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data types for Adventure Tours theme;</li>
<li>Slider Revolution;</li>
<li>Visual Composer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Updates for these plugins are distributed with the theme only ( if you don't have a personal license for Slider Revolution or Visual Composer plugins, of course ). If some of these plugins are updated with the new release, you will see a notice in your admin panel area that updates for plugin(s) will be available after running the theme update process. So please, don't ignore this notice and go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Install Plugins</strong> section and update the appropriate plugin(s).</p>
<p>Information about these plugins' updates are also available in the theme changelog.</p>
<h3>Update notices</h3><h4>Update from 1.X to 2.X</h4><p>After updating Adventure Tours from version 1.x to version 2.x, you can start using Visual Composer plugin. In order for the plugin to work properly, there is need to update some shortcodes, such as &quot;row&quot; to &quot;vc-row&quot; or &quot;column&quot; to &quot;vc-column&quot;. We've created a special tool for this task. When you open a page, a blog post or any other content for editing, please pay attention at the top notice that displayed on image below:</p>
<p><img src="img/content-normilizer-notice.jpg" class="img-polaroid"></p>
<p>To convert shortcodes automatically, press the button convert button and after that check that all your shortcodes were converted properly without any loss.</p>

<p>Q: <strong>How to change the title of the tour booking form?</strong><br>A: To change the title of the tour booking form, you should use <code>adventure_tours_booking_form_title</code> filter in your child theme.<br>For example, you can add the following code to the child theme functions.php file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-php">function filter_adventure_tours_booking_form_title( $title, $tour ) {
    $custom_title = get_post_meta( $tour-&gt;id, 'tour_booking_form_title', true );
    return $custom_title ? $custom_title : $title;
}
add_filter( 'adventure_tours_booking_form_title', 'filter_adventure_tours_booking_form_title', 10, 2);
</code></pre>
<p>The code above checks if a tour (passed via <code>$tour</code> argument) has value for <code>tour_booking_form_title</code> meta field and uses it as a title value if it is not empty. So after this filter has been added to your child theme, you are able to add the meta field with the name <code>tour_booking_form_title</code> to customize the booking form title for each tour. On how to manage custom fields, see <a href="http://wpsites.net/web-design/how-to-create-a-custom-field/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>How to change the submit button text of the tour booking form?</strong><br>A: Please use the filter <code>adventure_tours_booking_form_btn_text</code> and follow the instructions from the above question. Please don't forget to replace <code>tour_booking_form_title</code> with a different name for the meta field.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>Tour reviews do not appear.</strong><br>A: Before a review appears, admin should approve it on the tour editing page in the <strong>Reviews</strong> box or at <strong>Comments</strong> section of admin panel.

<p>Q: <strong>How to update my Easy MailChimp Forms from version 5.X to 6.X?</strong><br>A: Prior to theme version 1.0.6, Adventure Tours theme supported only version 5.X of Easy MailChimp Forms plugin. Since the theme version 1.0.6, support for plugin version 6.X is added. So if you are using Easy MailChimp Forms plugin, we strongly recommend you to update the plugin to version 6.X. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that you've updated Adventure Tours theme up to version 1.0.6 or above.</li>
<li>Make sure that you've updated Data types for Adventure Tours theme up to version 1.0.4 or above.</li>
<li>Update Easy MailChimp Forms plugin.</li>
<li>Deactivate and activate this plugin (this step is required to complete the migration process).</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Easy Forms &gt; Settings</strong> and enter your MailChimp API key again.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Easy Forms &gt; Opt-in Forms</strong> and create a subscription form for all the lists that you used before.</li>
<li>Update all places (pages/widgets) where you use <strong>[mailchimp_form]</strong> shortcode. Your code looks like this:  </li>
</ol>
<pre><code>[mailchimp_form mailchimp_list_id=&quot;123123123&quot; button_text=&quot;Subscribe&quot; title=&quot;Join the Newsletter&quot; ...]To receive our best monthly deals[/mailchimp_form]
</code></pre><p>Remove &quot;mailchimp_list_id&quot; attribute (has been replaced with new one) and add &quot;form_id&quot; attribute with your new form ID as the attribute's value. Now it should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[mailchimp_form form_id=&quot;1&quot; button_text=&quot;Subscribe&quot; title=&quot;Join the Newsletter&quot; ...]To receive our best monthly deals[/mailchimp_form]
</code></pre><p>Please check that all of your forms work correctly after migration. </p>

Q: <strong>How to avoid error &quot;File name too long...&quot; during updating process with Envato WordPress Toolkit plugin?</strong><br>A: This error may occur if your current theme version is 2.2.5 or below, so in order to avoid it, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>install and activate child theme provided with our full package archive, if you don't use it yet;</li>
<li>add following code to child theme <code>functions.php</code> file ( full path will look like this <code>wp-content/themes/adventure-tours-child/functions.php</code>):</li>

        if ( !empty( $options['hook_extra']['theme'] ) &amp;&amp; 'adventure-tours' == $options['hook_extra']['theme'] ) {
            $package = !empty( $options['package'] ) ? $options['package'] : '';
            if ( $package &amp;&amp; preg_match( '`^(http|https|ftp)://`i', $package ) &amp;&amp; ! file_exists( $package ) ) {
                // downloads update package to resolve issue with long name generated by `wp_tempnam` in `download_url` function
                $tmpfname = wp_tempnam();
                if ( $tmpfname ) {

                        'filename' =&gt; $tmpfname 
                    ) );

                    if ( is_wp_error( $response ) || 200 != wp_remote_retrieve_response_code( $response ) ) {
                        unlink( $tmpfname );

                        if ( $content_md5 ) {
                            $md5_check = verify_file_md5( $tmpfname, $content_md5 );
                            if ( is_wp_error( $md5_check ) ) {
                                unlink( $tmpfname );
                            }
                        }

                        if ( file_exists($tmpfname) ) {

    add_filter( 'upgrader_package_options', 'adventure_tours_filter_upgrader_package_options' );
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>update Adventure Tours theme via Envato Toolkit plugin;</li>
<li>now you can remvove this code from your child theme functions.php file, as since version 2.2.6 this fix included into theme itself ( or if you installed child theme only to apply this fix - you may just remove your child theme now, but BE SURE that you don't have any other customization there, as in this case you will have any option to restore them back! ).</li>
